    <h3>About Chiara</h3>
    <p><h5><em>...Your not-so-average girly coder</em></h5></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">Chiara Mapelli (pronounced<em> Key-ah-rah</em>) was born in October 1995 in Italy. After four years
    in London, two degrees and being skint at all times, I decided to make the move up north to Manchester
    make a start in the tech business. My studies have focused on languages (French and Arabic),
    as well as the Middle East as a region. I have a keen interest in counter-terrorism methods and in the ways
    how cyber security can be a valuable tool to prevent terror attacks on European soil.
    Also, as you can see I love <span style="color:#ff3399">pink!</p>

    <h3>Code Nation and me</h3>
    <p><h5><em>...Come on Barbie, let's go code!</em></h5></p>
    <img id="barbie" src= "Barbie.jpg"/>

      <h4>Why have I chosen to come here?</h4>
        <p style="text-align: justify">I started to code on my own thanks to CodeCademy and FreeCodeCamp at work.
          When I started being bored and tired of shouting customers complaining about things I had no control
          over, coding became the way out for me to relax and finally being in control of something.
          Although there are many ways to come to the same console.log outcome, the simple fact that I was
          able to actually create something has always been very exciting for me.</p>

          <p style="text-align: justify"> As one of my friends graduated from Northcoders not long ago, I went there for an interview.
          They have an entry challenge for people who want to attend their 12-week course. I religiously
          prepared for that test, but on the day of the challenge, I felt discouraged as the problems 
          were way too hard for what they told me to prepare for. After the test they told me to come back again
          one month later, without giving any feedback.</p>
        
         <p style="text-align: justify"> And then, I found Code Nation while finding for alternative schools. I decided to come and study here
          instead as the place is infinitely more welcoming and the attitude towards potential new students is much different.
          The school is very supportive and I feel like I have finally found what I want to do in my life.

      <h3>Targets</h3>
      <p style="text-align: justify">
      My target in the first week was to get acquainted with coding in an environment different than my home.
      Of course, having a bit of previous knowledge in JavaScript has helped me greatly, considering that 
      one of my objectives has been to improve my code.</p>
      
      <p style="text-align: justify">My targets for the second and third week is to learn as much as I can about HTML and CSS in order to
        create a website on my own so that I can build my knowledge of these languages whilst creating something that
        can be used as my portfolio in the future.

<div id="idea">
  <h3><emr>My idea of a <span style="color:deeppink"> project</span></emr>:</h3>

    <p style="text-align: justify"></p>There are three main steps to follow in order to effectively start a project:

        <p style="text-align: justify"><ol><li><strong>Describing:</strong></li></p>
        First, let's identify the purposes of IT in modern business:</p>
        <ul><li>  Communication;
        <li>  Accountability;</li>
        <li>  Organisation.</ul></li>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
        IT provides the tools needed for companies or individuals to successfully 
        run a business. With the advent of IT, organisations are finally able 
        to keep up with the ever-changing world of technology and innovation 
        and can excel at their tasks, wherever they are based.<br></p>
        
        <li><strong>Planning:</strong></li>
        <p style="text-align: justify">Second, the planning of a project entails more than just mind maps and graphs. 
        Since a project is delivered by people, it is recommended that each member meets 
        each other and is aware of their past projects and strongest skills.</p>
        Then,</p>
        <ul><li>Goals and desired outcomes are identified;
        <li>A delivery schedule is drafted according to a set timescale;</li>
        <li>Various portions of the budget are allocated to micro-projects according 
        to urgency.</li></ul></p>

        <li><strong>Selecting:</strong></li><p></p>
        </p style="text-align: justify">Finally, Identifying the goals in regard to the desired outcome of your project is 
        paramount when trying to select the right kind of technology for it.
        Three principal actions are required:</p>
        <ul><li>Research;</li>
        <li>Sort;</li>
        <li>Test.</ul></li>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
        Before establishing what the appropriate technology your project may need the 
        most, it is essential to research the market. In that way, we are more conscious 
        of what the needs of the market are, and whether it is worth investing a certain amount 
        of energy and funds in a project. After sorting out the finances and 
        realising how much we are able to invest, and specifically in what, 
        we can select what platforms to first test our product and get feedback to see 
        whether the investment might me worth it.</p>

      </ol>

  <h3><emr>How I would <span style="color:deeppink"> continue</span></emr> a project:</h3> 
    <p style="text-align: justify"></p>Again, I have three main steps to follow in order to effectively carry on with a project:
    
    <p style="text-align: justify"><ol><li><strong>Methods:</strong></li>
        A pre-tested business strategy; budget management analysis; real-time reporting or editing.</p>
        <li><strong>Skills:</strong> </li>Project management; organisation; communication; time-keeping; accuracy.</p>
        <li><strong>Resources:</strong></li>A strong internet connection; access to cloud-sharing platforms; to-do lists.</p>
        <li><strong>Tools:</strong></li>Laptops; internet; spreadsheets; tables; graphs; software like Trello.</p>
    </ol>
      </p>
        <br>
  </div>

  <div id="explanation"></div>
      <h3><emr>How I would <span style="color:deeppink"> explain</span></emr> a project:</h3> 
      <p style="text-align: justify"><ol><li><strong>Analysing:</strong></li></p>
        The rationale behind the choice of certain technologies over others is to be explained a posteriori. 
        Examples may be:</p>
        <ul><li>Budget restrictions;
        <li>Emphasis on aspects vs others (e.g. speed over aesthetics);</li>
        <li>The need to run a program on specific platforms only.</li>
          </ul>
            <br>
        </div>

      <li><strong>Preventing:</strong></li>
          <p style="text-align: justify">Studies have showed that the digital technology industry has a success rate below 60%. 
          What causes digital projects to fail? Reasons, amongst others, are:</p>
          <ul><li>Limited digital strategy or access to digital resources;
          <li>Inadequate training or experience of team members;</li>
          <li>Mismatch of skills.</li></ul></p>

      <li><strong>GDPR and privacy:</strong></li>
          <p style="text-align: justify">The EU General Data Protection Regulation (known as GDPR) is a legal object designed to protect the personal data of individuals. Whilst undoubtedly important, 
            GDPR could pose constraints on digital projects. For instance, it may:</p>
          <ul><li>Impact the freedom and convenience of cloud-sharing platforms that are useful while working on the same 
            project from different locations;
          <li>Require businesses to invest more in ensuring that their compliance is on point, 
            with this swaying funds from other projects;</li>
          <li>Slow down the execution of new projects because of legal intricacies.</li></ul></p>
        <br>

  
    <div id="review">
        <h3><emr>Project review and improvements</emr></h3>
        <br>
        <strong>Review of tools:</strong>
        <p style="text-align: justify">In making my own website I predominantly used Trello, Visual Studio
        Code, and Google Chrome, in this order. The first is useful to draft and visualize the content
        of the website, the second in that I was able to test HTML, JavaScript and CSS codes simultaneously,
        and the last in order to see the product of my work.</p>
        The <span style="color:purple">strengths</span> of these IT tools have been:</p>
        <ul><li>Visualizing the contents and mind-mapping my project beforehand;
        <li>The opportunity to test my code on three different pages;</li>
        <li>Using the Developers' tools to see the different sections of the page and quickly being
          able to know what to edit in my code.</li></ul></p> 
        However, some <span style="color:deeppink">weaknesses</span> have been:</p>
        <ul><li>The fact that I had to save my code and refresh the page to see changes;
        <li>The limited use of the <em>'magical'</em> JavaScript;</li>
        <li>The not-so-much dynamism or flowiness of the page.</li></ul></p> 
        <br>
        In terms of future <span style="color:pink">improvements</span>, the idea is to incorporate
        further elements in the CSS.style document in order to improve the styling and to learn how to
        make the most of JavaScript.</p>
